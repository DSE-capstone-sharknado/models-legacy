Thanks for downloading this code. Here is the procedure that gets you started quickly.

Step 1. Download the review corpus + image features of Amazon Clothing data from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. 


Step 2. Preprocess the data.
Note that in the WWW'16 paper, we experimented with two categories (i.e., Men, Women) under this corpus. Here we provide the code (under the directory /tools) to help you get the review corpus + image feature file for each of these categories. 

(1) For review corpus, first use "convert_to_simple.py" to covert the original review corpus to a *simple* form (non-json). Then use the tool "getClothingSubReviews" to get the review corpora for different categories. Finally compress each of them using gzip.

(2) For image features, use the tool "getClothingSubImgFeatures" to get the image feature files directly.
In each case, you would need the category metadata file named "productMeta_simple.txt.gz", which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Ck8jw-TZUELVRLMVdJNTRUU0U/view?usp=sharing


Step 3. "make" the code.


Step 4. Run the binary file "train".



Have fun!
